   Read, Write, Append To Files

Compiling Header Files:
gcc -c [name_of_header_file] // Will Produce Object File Of Header File
gcc -c [name_of_implementation_file] //Will Produce Object File Of Implementation File
gcc [name_of_implementation_object] [name_of_header_object] -o [name_of_exe_file] //Generates Exe By Combining Object Files
